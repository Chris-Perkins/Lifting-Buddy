Track which versions of your iOS or Mac OS X app a user has previously installed.

Usage
------------

Call this on each app launch inside `application:didFinishLaunching:withOptions:` (iOS), or `-applicationDidFinishLaunching:` (OS X)

```objective-c
[GBVersionTracking track];
```

Then call these whenever you want (in these examples the user has launched a bunch of previous versions, and this is the first time he's launched the new version which is version 3.0):

```objective-c
[GBVersionTracking isFirstLaunchEver];				//Returns: NO
[GBVersionTracking isFirstLaunchForVersion];		//Returns: YES
[GBVersionTracking isFirstLaunchForBuild];			//Returns: YES
 
[GBVersionTracking currentVersion];					//Returns: @"3.0"
[GBVersionTracking previousVersion];				//Returns: @"2.1"
[GBVersionTracking firstInstalledVersion];			//Returns: @"1.0"
[GBVersionTracking versionHistory];					//Returns: [@"1.0", @"2.0", @"2.1", @"3.0"]
 
[GBVersionTracking currentBuild];					//Returns: @"3004"
[GBVersionTracking previousBuild];					//Returns: @"2107"
[GBVersionTracking firstInstalledBuild];			//Returns: @"1000"
[GBVersionTracking buildHistory];					//Returns: [@"1000", @"2043", @"2107", @"3004"]
 ```

N.B.: The build and version numbers are whatever you define in your app's Info.plist

Don't forget to import header:

```objective-c
#import <GBVersionTracking/GBVersionTracking.h>
```

Installation
------------

Use CocoaPods, add this to your project's Podfile and run `pod install`:

```
pod 'GBVersionTracking'
```
