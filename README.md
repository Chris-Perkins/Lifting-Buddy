### Road Map:

| Process                   | Progress (Estimation) | Notes                                          |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Exercise Creation         | 9/10                  | Add nice way to choose progression method unit |

### Known Bugs
No outstanding bugs at this time.

### Future plans
* Convert relevant UIViews into ViewControllers (good practice)<br>
   Update from 11/29 -- my shower thoughts said this wasn't a good idea. Reason being that containerviewcontrollers would require the frames to be set anyway, which is what I wanted to avoid<br>
* Add "Feature Poll", a poll that users can use to vote on for the next feature<br>
* Log in to sync and backup workouts
